in the Google form. Statements expressing opinions, sentiments, or
conjectures are not considered valid inquiries and will not receive a
response. Further, contractors are reminded that the government will not
address hypothetical questions aimed at receiving a potential
"evaluation" decision.

Answers will be provided as an amendment to the solicitation.

## Evaluation Criteria and Quote Submittal Instructions 

Quotes will be evaluated on the factors listed below. Failure to follow
the instructions may result in the quote being removed from further
consideration for award. Contractors are cautioned not to include
assumptions, caveats, or exceptions within any part of their submission.
Inclusion of assumptions, caveats, or exceptions to the requirement of
any kind may result in the quote no longer being considered. Contractors
should ONLY submit information explicitly requested in this RFQ.

### Phase 1 - Technical Submissions

Technical submissions *must* consist of:

-   **Criteria 1:** a technical approach of no more than four (4)
    additional pages to the performance work statement (PWS),
-   **Criteria 2:** a staffing plan of no more than three (3) pages plus
    resumes and signed letters of intent to participate, and
-   **Criteria 3:** references to one or more source code samples.

Technical submissions *may* also include user research plans and design
artifacts of no more than 3 pages combined.

Technical approach and staffing plans must be submitted using 12-point
type. Submissions over the page limits above will not be considered.

#### Criteria 1 - Technical Approach

The technical approach must set forth the contractor's proposed approach
to providing the services required, including the base software (if any)
and programming language(s) the contractor proposes to use. The
technical approach must also make clear that the contractor understands
the details of the project requirements. The technical approach must
also identify potential obstacles to efficient development and include
plans to overcome those potential obstacles. The technical approach must
also include a description of the contractor's plans, if any, to provide
services through a joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontractors.

Contractors must complete the sections in **RED** of attached
(PWS). Submission of any other template will constitute a non-responsive
quote.

#### Criteria 2 - Staffing Plan

The staffing plan must set forth the contractor's proposed approach to
staffing the requirements of this project, including the titles of each
of the labor categories proposed and proposed level of effort for each
member of the contractor's development team (i.e. full time, half time,
etc.). The staffing plan must also identify the proposed Facilitator,
Technical Lead and Design Lead by name, and include a resume for each.
The resumes must include a brief description of the experience and
capability for each individual, but cannot exceed one (1) page in length
each. Contractors proposing Key Personnel who are not currently employed
by the contractor or a teaming partner must include a signed letter of
intent from the individual proposed as Key Personnel that he/she intends
to participate in this project for at least one year. The staffing plan
must also set forth the extent to which the proposed team for this
project was involved in the development of the source code referred to
in the next paragraph.

The staffing plan must set forth and explain the extent to which the
contractor will provide individuals with experience in most the
following areas:

-   Agile development practices
-   Automated (unit/integration/end-to-end) testing
-   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
-   Refactoring to minimize technical debt
-   Application Protocol Interface (API) development and documentation
-   Open-source software development
-   Cloud deployment
-   Open-source login/authentication services
-   Product management and strategy
-   Usability research, such as (but not limited to) contextual inquiry,
    stakeholder interviews, and usability testing
-   User experience design
-   Sketching, wireframing, and/or prototyping, and user-task flow
    development
-   Visual design
-   Content design and copywriting
-   Building and testing public facing sites and tools
-   User outreach / user adoption
-   Database design and SQL queries
-   Security / compliance

#### Criteria 3 - Similar Experience

The similar experience references to one or more source code samples
must be either links to Git repositories (either credentialed or public)
or to equivalent version-controlled repositories that provide the
evaluation team with the full revision history for all files. If a
contractor submits a link to a private Git repository hosted with
GitHub, the government will provide the contractor with one or more
GitHub user identities by email, and the contractor will be expected to
promptly provide the identified user(s) with access to the private Git
repository.

The source code samples should be for projects that are similar in size,
scope, and complexity to the project contemplated here. The source code
must have been developed by either (i) the contractor itself, (ii) a
teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or (iii) an
individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project. The
government would prefer that the source code samples have been for
recent projects involving teams of approximately four to seven full-time
equivalent (FTE) personnel.

If the references to source code samples provided do not include
associated references to user research plans and design artifacts
demonstrating how ongoing user research was incorporated into the
project, then the contractor must submit a user research plan and design
artifacts relating to at least one (1) of the source code samples
provided.

### Phase 2 - Verbal Interviews

**General Information**

*Format.* After review of Phase 1 -- Technical Submissions, the
government will invite all contractors with a rating of "Some
Confidence" or "High Confidence" to Phase 2 - Verbal Interview. Each
contractor will be scheduled a 60-minute interview with the evaluation
team so they can ask questions based on contractor's technical
submission. Contractors should also introduce their team members who
will be part of the support team. Lastly, the evaluation team will ask
questions in regards to their expertise relative to the project.

*Location.* The interview sessions will be conducted by video chat,
though audio may be substituted as needed. The government will
coordinate and set up the virtual meeting space accordingly (by
providing dial-in or links).

*Date and Time.* The government will schedule the date and time of the
interviews with each contractor after the RFQ closing date and receipt
of "Some Confidence" or "High Confidence" quote submissions. The
government reserves the right to reschedule any contractor's interview
date at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

Each interview will include an unstructured question and answer session,
during which contractors will be asked questions about the technical
aspects of their quote and their approach to software development. The
government expects these interviews will assist in assessing the
technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better
understand the proposed technical approach described in the contractor's
written submission. All of the contractor's proposed Key Personnel must
participate in the interview.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last no more than 5
minutes, during which the contractor and government interview team
members will introduce themselves.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last no more than 45
minutes, during which the Contractor interview team will respond to the
government's questions related to the technical aspects of the
contractor's quote. Contractors will NOT be able to use or present any
slides, graphs, charts, or other written presentation materials,
including handouts. There will be no follow-up session for further
questions after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will no more than 5 minutes,
during which the contractor may make a short presentation summarizing
the contractor's responses to the government's questions.

The interview associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute
discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made
during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government
will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit
or allow revised quotes.

**Once interviews are complete, each contractor will be assigned a
confidence rating.**

### Phase 3 - Price Submissions

The government expects that the labor categories and staffing levels set
forth by the contractor in the Excel workbook will be consistent with
the contractor's staffing plan and with their GSA Schedule contract
pricing.

The Contractor will be compensated at fully loaded hourly rates. The
evaluation team intends to evaluate quotes without discussions with
contractors, and therefore the contractor's initial quote should contain
the contractor's best terms.

In an effort to receive the highest quality solution at the lowest
possible price, the government requires discounts on all materials and
services offered by contractors for this requirement in order to be
considered for award. Contractors are encouraged to offer discounts
below schedule contract rates, whichever is applicable. When discounts
are offered, quotations must clearly identify the contract rate, the
discount rate, and the percentage discount for each item or labor rate
being discounted.

The contractor must provide a copy of their GSA Price Lists for all
three (3) years for verification of pricing. If submitting a quote as a
CTA, each member must submit their schedule pricing for each SIN they
are eligible to perform under. If price discounts are not provided on
the GSA price list, then the contractor will be deemed unacceptable.

For contractors that do not have out-year pricing, your task order
pricing may be escalated at the same percentage of your GSA multiple
award schedule (MAS) contract provided you submit a copy of a valid
executed modification of your GSA MAS schedule to the CO.

The government is expecting price reductions for every rate proposed for
the entire period(s) of performance. Prices will be verified to ensure
they do not exceed the contractor\'s Schedule contract price. Prices
will be evaluated with regard to whether discounted rates are offered or
not. Quotes proposing labor rates that exceed those established in the
contractor's BPA contract will not be considered for award.



Contractors will submit an Excel-based spreadsheet detailing the labor
categories, contract rates, discount rates and discount percentages.
This submission must not be submitted in PDF format.

Contractors must complete the sections in **BLUE** of the attached the
Pricing Sheet. The Pricing Sheet attached to this solicitation must be
completed and returned in Excel format with formulae intact. Submission
of any other price sheet will constitute a non-responsive quote.

## Basis of Award and Evaluation Factors

The government will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria
set forth below and then make an award based on best value using
tradeoffs. The government intends to utilize a phased approach for this
procurement as described below. To be considered for award, contractors
must successfully pass through each phase.

The government will award a task order resulting from this RFQ to the
responsible contractor whose quote conforms to the RFQ that represents
the best value to the government, price and the other criteria specified
below. Contractors are advised that the non-price evaluation factors
combined are significantly more important than price. As non-price
ratings become closer, price will become more important.

-   Phase 1 -- Technical Submission
    -   **Criteria 1**: Technical Approach
    -   **Criteria 2**: Staffing Plan
    -   **Criteria 3**: Similar Experience
-   Phase 2 - **Criteria 4**: Verbal interview
-   Phase 3 - Price Submission

Contractors must meet all requirements in Phase 1 and will be assigned a
confidence rating. After the initial Phase 1 confidence assignment,
contractors with a ranking of "Some Confidence" or "High Confidence"
will be invited for Phase 2 - Verbal Interview.

Quotes that have failed to meet the criteria established in Phase 1 will
no longer be considered for award. Contractors that pass Phase 2 with a
"Some Confidence" or "High Confidence" will be evaluated based on their
price submission.

The government will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by
evaluating the hourly rate for each labor category and the overall
discount provided off the contractor's GSA schedule pricing. This will
include evaluating estimated hours submitted by the contractor for the
purpose of considering the estimated total cost to the government. The
government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option
prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options under FAR
_52.217-8_ will be accomplished by using the prices offered
for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option
period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive
at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the
government to exercise the option(s).

The government also reserves the right to make no award.

**NOTE: The government anticipates selecting an awardee based upon
initial quotes received; therefore, contractors are cautioned to submit
their best price and technical quotes in the initial submission.**

### Evaluation:

#### Technical Approach

In evaluating a contractor's technical approach, the government will
consider (a) the quality of the contractor's plans to provide the open
source, agile development services required, including user research and
design, (b) the extent of the contractor's understanding of the details
of the project requirements, and (c) the extent to which the contractor
has identified potential obstacles to efficient development, and has
proposed realistic approaches to overcome those potential obstacles.

#### Staffing Plan

In evaluating a contractor's staffing plan, the government will consider
(a) the skills and experience of the Key Personnel and other individuals
that the contractor plans to use to provide the required services, (b)
the mix of labor categories that will comprise the contractor's proposed
development team, and (c) the contractor's proposed number of hours of
services to be provided by each member of the contractor's proposed
development team.

#### Similar Experience

In evaluating a contractor's similar experience, the government will
consider the extent to which the contractor has recently provided
software development services for projects that are similar in size,
scope, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ, and the
quality of those services. In evaluating the quality of those services,
the evaluation team will consider, among other things, the revision
history for all files in the source code samples provided. The
government will also consider the user research and design-related
artifacts that were associated with the source code samples provided or
submitted separately. In considering a contractor's similar experience,
the government may also consider information from any other source,
including contractor's prior customers and public websites.

#### Price

In evaluating a contractor's price, the government will consider the
total of the contractor's estimated costs for the development services,
and travel expenses proposed, for three years (a base year period plus
two one-year option periods). Contractors will use this Excel
[workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gHAF8oBsC5oMWsQN2VtKSjtM8rhX2uFDnEYRw9kYu9M/edit#gid=0)
to submit pricing information.
