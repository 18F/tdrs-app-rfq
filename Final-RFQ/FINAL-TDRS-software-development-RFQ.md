1.0 Purpose and Background
--------------------------

### 1.1 Purpose

In fiscal year 2020, the [[Office of Family
Assistance]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa) (OFA) within the
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) entered into an
interagency agreement with [[18F]{.underline}](https://18f.gsa.gov/)
within the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) to provide assisted
acquisition services for the procurement of software development
services in support of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) program. OFA is seeking a contractor to assist with the
development of a new TANF Data Reporting System (TDRS). 18F will award
the contract and provide contractual and administrative support to OFA.
OFA will oversee contractor performance and review deliverables. 18F
will provide procurement and technical support to OFA for the life of
the contract.

### 1.2 Background

18F applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the
public's experience with government by helping agencies make their
services more accessible, efficient, effective, and by providing
services that exemplify these values.

The Office of Family Assistance (OFA) has entered into an interagency
agreement (IAA) with 18F for assisted acquisition services. 18F will
acquire the services requested in this solicitation on behalf of OFA and
administer the contract in post award.

OFA, within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF),
administers the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program
on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since
1996, the TANF program has served as one of the nation's primary
economic security and stability programs for low-income families with
children. TANF is a block grant that provides \$16.6 billion annually to
states, territories, the District of Columbia, and federally-recognized
Indian tribes. These TANF jurisdictions use federal TANF funds to
provide income support as well as a wide range of services to vulnerable
families with minor children.

As part of oversight and administration of the TANF Program, OFA
operates the TANF Data Reporting System (TDRS).

OFA\'s TANF grantees submit data to TDRS that they are
legislatively-mandated to report. OFA then aggregates the data and uses
it for descriptive analyses and program accountability, most notably
through the work participation rate calculations. Work participation
rates measure the degree to which families receiving TANF assistance are
engaged in work activities specified under federal law. States,
territories, and tribes must meet both an overall work participation
rate and a two-parent work participation rate or be subject to a
financial penalty.

The existing system was developed in the late 1990s with only minor
updates in the past 20 years.

The TANF grantees usually generate their data in one of the following
ways (review [[information about the incoming data
format]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanfedit/index#transmission-file-header)):

-   Using a legacy tool (ftanf.exe) that exports files in a special text
    > format

-   Using their own software to export the data

-   Emailing their data to an OFA staff member to be entered for them

The data is then uploaded using secure file transfer protocol (SFTP)
into a system which then periodically attempts to process the data and
import it into the database OFA staff uses for analysis. OFA staff
access the data via direct read-only SQL queries using tools like
python, Jupyter Notebooks, and SAS.

The database currently is around 50GB in size, though most of it is
historical data which will not need to be migrated. Most of the tables
contain between 700,000 to 1,300,000 rows and most of the data is stored
in seven tables. These tables are renamed periodically so there is a
historical record. Access to this data is extremely limited, both
because the data is sensitive (contains personally identifiable
information or PII) and because managing access to these aging systems
is difficult.

### 1.3 Problem

The current TDRS application was developed in the late 1990s and doesn't
take advantage of modern technology or best practices. The system is
inflexible to changing requirements, not automated, has no real user
interface, doesn't validate data effectively, and doesn't provide OFA
with full ownership of the inputted data. This puts a disproportionate
amount of burden on all users of the system --- both federal staff and
the state, local, and tribe grantees --- and has led to a painful user
experience and often untimely or inaccurate data.

States, tribes, and territories distribute cash assistance in various
ways and collect information about recipients in a variety of different
systems. Some of this data is passed to OFA through TDRS and is critical
to OFA's responsibility to report on the TANF program. The data provides
information about how grantees are meeting their work participation rate
targets and complying with time limits, as well as demographic
information about families receiving TANF cash assistance.

High quality data leads to informed decision-making, and the TANF
program relies on this information to make policy recommendations.
Additionally, states and territories may face penalties of up to four
percent of their total grant award each quarter if TDRS data is not
timely, complete, and accurate.

Issues with the current system prevent states from meeting their goals
and prevent the federal team from being able to accurately gauge TANF's
impact. Dealing with the deficiencies of the aging software is taking up
significant amounts of the OFA staff time.

### 1.4 Current Prototype 

OFA has partnered with 18F to conduct the initial research, scoping,
prototyping, and strategy for the new TDRS. 18F has laid the groundwork
for a modern and sustainable software development process and removed as
many barriers as possible for the incoming contractor team. This
information may highlight important considerations for future
development team, and should not constrain contractor's technical
approach submissions.

The current TDRS is so old, fragile, and difficult to access that 18F
only leveraged the existing data format that grantees use to submit
their data to TDRS and did not develop any direct access to the system.
This [[data
format]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanfedit/index#transmission-file-header)
is not extensible, not human-readable, and does not have adequate
documentation. However, the data format is standardized and does not
immediately require the grantees to change their data generation
processes. Both OFA staff and grantees would like a user interface for
entering data in the new system, but developing this will require more
user research.

This new [[TDRS prototype]{.underline}](https://github.com/HHS/Tanf-app)
was built to test assumptions about the primary goal of this project. At
the time of the release of this RFQ, the prototype allows users to
upload data in the [[TANF data reporting
format]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanfedit/index)
and view the resulting data. It conducts limited data validation of the
submissions.

It is a Python/Django app with Login.gov integration, and running in
Cloud.gov. The OFA team uses SQL with their existing analysis tools, so
18F developed the prototype with a Postgres SQL database. The contractor
may extend, extract useful parts, or replace the prototype application
entirely.

The prototype provided an opportunity to develop an application
environment. 18F and OFA have been working together to get core
technical infrastructure approved and set up so when the contractor
joins the team they can immediately begin to contribute code and have it
automatically roll out to their development environment.

The application environment is roughly:

![](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="5.305555555555555in"}

This infrastructure should provide OFA and the contractor with a system
that will be easy to learn, manage, and use. The components are:

-   [[Cloud.gov]{.underline}](https://cloud.gov/) This is a
    > GovCloud-based platform-as-a-service that removes almost all of
    > the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance from the system, is
    > already procured for OFA, and has a [[FedRAMP Joint Authorization
    > Board]{.underline} [Provisional Authority to Operate (JAB
    > P-ATO]{.underline}](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/18f-cloudgov?sort=productName))
    > on file. FedRAMP is a standardized federal security assessment for
    > cloud services, and the FedRAMP ATO helps agencies by providing
    > confidence in the security of cloud solutions and security
    > assessments. Cloud.gov supports all [[modern software development
    > frameworks]{.underline}](https://cloud.gov/docs/deployment/frameworks/#fully-maintained-language-support)
    > so the contractor team does not need to continue in Python/Django
    > if they prefer another language/framework.

-   [[Login.gov]{.underline}](https://www.login.gov/) The TDRS
    > application requires strong multi-factor authentication for the
    > states, tribes, and territories and Personal Identity Verification
    > (PIV) authentication for OFA staff. Login.gov can meet both of
    > these requirements and HHS already has an IAA for this service.
    > Login.gov has a [[FedRAMP
    > ATO]{.underline}](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/logingov)
    > on file.

-   [[CircleCI]{.underline}](https://circleci.com/) This is a CI/CD
    > system that is commonly used by 18F. CircleCI has an [[FedRAMP ATO
    > on
    > file]{.underline}](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/circleci-cloud).
    > It is used to automate builds, testing, and deploys from GitHub.

### 1.5 Product Vision

OFA will build a new, secure, web-based data reporting system to improve
the federal reporting experience for TANF grantees and federal staff.
The new system will allow grantees to directly and easily upload their
data and be confident that they have fulfilled their reporting
requirements. This will reduce the burden on all users, free up staff
time, improve data quality, and ultimately help low-income families.

2.0 Scope, Expectations, Anticipated Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, and Ceiling Amount
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Scope

OFA seeks agile software development services to begin work toward the
product vision of a user-friendly data system. The services to be
provided under this task order will include all aspects of the software
development process --- including initial planning, design, user
research, software development and coding, prototyping, documentation,
testing, and configuration. And once the new app is released, the
contractor will assist with troubleshooting, bug resolution, operational
support, and incident response.

OFA is not looking to migrate data from the existing TANF system to the
new system. OFA will continue to access the old database independently
for any longitudinal reporting. They are prepared to adapt their current
tools to whatever new table structure is created with the new system.
However, there will probably be a transition period where data uploaded
to the old system with sftp will need to be synced to the new system,
and vice versa, but this is the only legacy integration required. The
transition from the legacy system to the new system will be a
partnership between the ACF OCIO and the contractor. Historical data is
not needed in the new system because longitudinal analyses are done
outside the system and we already have that data to combine with new
data.

Data validation rules will need to be adapted from current data
validation rules (see ACF-199 Instructions and Error Codes). The
contractor is expected to continue user research and conversations with
OFA to develop the updated validation rules.

>
> [[https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanfedit/index]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanfedit/index)
>
> [[https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tribal-tanf-data-coding-instructions]{.underline}](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tribal-tanf-data-coding-instructions)

**2.2 Expectations**

This software development project will use agile development principles,
with robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible
infrastructure. OFA expects that the development process will be
collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent
communication between OFA, 18F partners, and the contractor.

OFA expects that the development process will consist of sprint cycles,
and that the initial phases of the development process will focus on
creating a system to securely allow the upload of state, territory, and
tribal data; validating the data; storing the data in a database;
providing information on the status of the import/validation to the
state, territory, and tribal users; and allowing the state, territory,
and tribal users to see and download their data in the system.

OFA has designated an employee who will serve as the Product Owner for
this project. OFA's Product Owner will liaise with other stakeholders,
weigh business needs, set direction, make prioritization choices, build
a product roadmap, and support the development team. 18F partners and
the contractor will assist OFA with product management.

Additional OFA subject matter experts will be available promptly to
assist in the development process, including internal usability testing.
OFA will arrange for any necessary internal and external usability
testing.

ACF, not the contractor, will be responsible for hosting the deployed
system and obtaining any necessary Authority to Operate (ATO). ACF will
also determine what security controls are required and whether they have
been satisfied. OFA expects to provide those security controls to the
contractor as either acceptance criteria or separate user stories. These
controls will align with the system categorization and control selection
as part of the ACF Governance Framework, which will be tailored toward
an agile practice. The contractor is expected to use best practices for
security (see Appendix 1) in delivering code. Contractors will be
expected to document the system's non-inherited controls in the
[[OpenControl]{.underline}](https://open-control.org/) or
[[OSCAL]{.underline}](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) format. The
contractor may be asked to amend the implementation and documentation of
the selected controls following security review assessments by ACF. ACF
will be responsible for conducting system testing during security
assessment, and the contractor may support testing activities.

The contractor must post all developed code to a public source
repository (such as GitHub) designated by OFA.

### 2.3 Anticipated Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, and Ceiling Amount

The period of performance will include a one-year base period with two
one-year option periods. The contract type for this effort will be time
and materials (T&M).

The estimated cost for this effort is \$1.4 million for requested
services and authorized travel incurred during the base period. The
government does not expect this project to continue past one year with a
full contractor team. If the contract is extended into year two or
three, it will likely be at a reduced level of effort and not to exceed
\$1.4 million for services and authorized travel for each option period.

3.0 Objectives
--------------

### 3.1 Backlog

The preliminary user stories below are the starting point for the
development of software to be provided under this contract. **These
preliminary user stories are provided only for illustrative purposes,
and do not comprise the full scope or detail of the project.**

OFA expects that the contractor will work closely with the Product Owner
to perform regular user research and usability testing and to develop
and prioritize a full gamut of user stories as the project progresses.
Individual user stories will be refined, added to, retracted,
sub-divided, and reprioritized by the product team throughout the
development process.

    > tribes that receive block grant TANF funding from the federal
    > government. These individuals are responsible for reporting data
    > about TANF recipients to OFA through TDRS.

-   **OFA analyst:** OFA staff who review, analyze, and report on
    > grantee data submitted through TDRS.

-   **Grantee program director:** Manages grantee admins and trains them
    > on how to submit data to OFA.

### 3.2 Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The government will use the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
**(**QASP) to monitor the quality of the contractor's deliverables and
performance. This oversight will help the government ensure that
contractor performance reaches required levels throughout the contract
term. The QASP provides the government with a proactive way to avoid
unacceptable or deficient performance and provides the basis for
performance ratings in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting
System (CPARS). The QASP may be updated by modification to the contract.
The QASP provides the basis for performing and controlling the project's
activities in accordance with the contract.

The following chart sets forth the performance standards and quality
levels the code and documentation provided by the contractor must meet,
and the methods OFA will use to assess the standard and quality levels
of that code and documentation.

4.0 Contract Place of Performance and Contract Type
---------------------------------------------------

Any work done, whether onsite or offsite, must be covered by the rate
agreed upon between the government and contractor. Normal working hours
are from 9:00AM to 5:00PM Eastern time Monday through Friday. The
contractor will generally be expected to be readily available during
core working hours from 10:00am to 4:00pm Eastern time Monday through
Friday. They are not expected to work federal holidays. If the federal
government shuts down for any reason, contractors may seek approval from
the COR to telework during this time.

The contractor may choose the location(s) from which to perform the
required software development services. The contractor will not be
required to work at a government facility however, occasional travel to
government facilities may be required. Actual travel costs to government
facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with [[federal travel
regulation]{.underline}](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr).
All travel must be approved by the contracting officer's representative
(COR) prior to booking.

The government intends to award a time and material (T&M) type contract.
All rates shall be fully burdened and T&M rates are fixed at the time of
award. The offeror must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each
labor category applies to labor performed by--- (1) The offeror; (2)
Subcontractors; and/or (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates or the
offeror under a common control.

5.0 Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements) 
-------------------------------------------------------

### **5.1 System Requirements** 

The System must:

-   Incorporate an intuitive, web-based interface that is accessible
    > from both internal and external platforms, including desktops,
    > laptops, tablets, thin/zero clients, and mobile devices

-   Incorporate application programming interfaces (APIs) to
    > intermediate major components

-   Be highly available to users and have adequate capacity to handle
    > the load

-   Include Login.gov user authentication and authorization
    > functionality and use open source encryption protocols for all
    > data transmission.

-   Be developed in Cloud.gov and must eventually migrate to another ACF
    > cloud environment. The type of environment is unknown at this
    > time, so the application should be written to be as operationally
    > portable as possible.

### 5.2 Authentication Requirements

The software must have multi-factor authentication for the grantees and
PIV authorization for the OFA staff and key personnel. The Login.gov
system has already been procured to fulfill this requirement.

### 5.3 Software Requirements

The software architecture must be extensible to allow for future
development including the addition of new statutorily mandated data
reporting. The code base must incorporate analytics, monitoring,
testing, and measurement tools. Application design and development must
use [[plain
language]{.underline}](https://content-guide.18f.gov/plain-language/) to
the extent practical.

### 5.4 **Design Requirements** 

Any website that is developed or otherwise delivered as a result of this
contract shall be in compliance with the [[website
standards]{.underline}](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/)
of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services
Administration.

The contractor will employ the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) and create
design elements that are reusable by OFA.

### **5.5 Environments** 

The System will be developed and initially hosted on Cloud.gov (a
FedRAMP-certified internet-connected Platform as a Service). OFA will
own and manage the Cloud.gov account and create development, staging,
and production environments for this project within that account. The
contractor will have access to the development environment and will be
responsible for maintaining that environment. The contractor must post
all developed code to the public source repository as designated by OFA.
OFA will be responsible for creating and managing this repository. OFA
will be responsible for setting up and maintaining a Continuous
Integration/Continuous Deployment system to automate the deployment of
the code in GitHub, and the contractor will be able to contribute
configuration-related code that will improve it as needed-related code
that will improve it as needed. OFA will be responsible for creating,
maintaining, and managing the Login.gov integrations.

### 5.6 System Access

All contractor personnel working under the resulting contract will need
to obtain a Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12
([[HSPD-12]{.underline}](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12))
low risk security clearance (or moderate risk security clearance if
handling PII).

In addition, the contractor's key personnel will need to obtain a
personal identity verification (PIV) card in order to perform legacy
system integration work. See Appendix 1 - Section 1.6 for details.

Contractor personnel that are required to obtain a PIV card will be
issued a government-furnished laptop from HHS/ACF. Any work that
requires access to and handling of PII must be performed on the HHS/ACF
government-furnished laptop. Contractor personnel that are not required
to obtain a PIV card can use contractor-furnished equipment to perform
work. The government does not anticipate that contractor personnel will
need to access PII data initially.

Contractors may have to establish multi-factor authentication (MFA) to
access systems that require government laptops with PIV cards or to
access other applications that require MFA.

6.0 Personnel Skills and Knowledge
----------------------------------

### 6.1 Key Personnel

The contractor must designate who will fill these three roles:
Facilitator, Technical Lead, and Design Lead. The Technical and Design
Leads should not be the same person, but either may fill the role of
Facilitator, or the Facilitator can be a separate person.

**The Facilitator** will be a direct liaison to the government product
team, and will be responsible for the supervision and management of all
contractor personnel. This person should have a background as a scrum
master, product manager, agile coach, or a similar role.

**The Technical Lead** must have a full understanding of the technical
approach to be used by the contractor's development team and will be
responsible for ensuring that the contractor's development team follows
that approach. This person should have a background as an engineer.

**The Design Lead** must have a full understanding of the research
approach and design patterns to be used by the contractor's development
team and will be responsible for ensuring that the contractor's
development team follows that approach. This person should have a
background as a user experience researcher or designer.

### 6.2 Key Personnel Substitution 

Key Personnel substitutions must be submitted to the contracting officer
(CO) in writing, and will only be justified in the event of sudden
illness, death, change of employment, or termination of employment for
cause. Contractor requests for a substitution of Key Personnel must
include a detailed explanation of the justifying circumstances, and a
complete résumé for the proposed substitute or addition, including
skills, experience, training, and security clearance level (if
applicable). The CO's failure to approve a proposed substitution will
not constitute grounds for non-performance by the contractor, or form a
valid basis for any claim for money or any equitable adjustment.

### 6.3 Skills 

The contractor must provide a cross functional team that is experienced
in working in an agile process. They must be comfortable delivering
value iteratively and be able to pivot quickly based on a continuous
learning environment. The contractor will use prototypes and working
software as tools to test hypotheses and validate assumptions. The
contractor should deliver working software early in the post-award
period and iteratively improve the software through ongoing development
sprints.

The relevant skills for this project *may* include:

-   Product management

-   Back-end engineering

-   Front-end engineering

-   Development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) engineering

-   User research

-   Content design

-   GSA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): Rebecca Refoy-Sidibe

-   OFA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): Dvora Wilensky

The government will notify the contractor if a change occurs to either
the CO or COR. Specifically for the COR, the contractor will receive a
copy of the "COR Delegation of Authority" assignment letter when a COR
is assigned, and the contractor will also receive a letter rescinding
the COR's delegation when appropriate.

### 7.2 Authorities and Delegations

**7.2.1** The TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) is the only organization
authorized to enter into or terminate this task order, modify any term
or condition of this agreement, waive any requirement of this agreement,
or accept nonconforming work.

**7.2.2** The CO will designate a COR at the time of award. The COR will
be responsible for technical monitoring of the contractor\'s performance
and deliverables. The COR will be appointed in writing and a copy of the
appointment will be furnished to the contractor. Changes to this
delegation will be made by written changes to the existing appointment
or by issuance of a new appointment.

**7.2.3** The COR is not authorized to perform, formally or informally,
any of the following actions:

-   Promise, award, agree to award, or execute any agreement,
    > modification, or notice of intent that changes or may change this
    > contract

-   Waive or agree to modification of the delivery schedule

-   Make any final decision on any contract matters subject to the
    > disputes clause

-   Terminate, for any reason, the contractor\'s right to proceed

-   Obligate in any way, the payment of money by the government

The contractor shall comply with the written or oral direction of the CO
or authorized representative(s) acting within the scope and authority of
the appointment memorandum. The contractor need not proceed with
direction that it considers to have been issued without proper
authority. The contractor shall notify the CO in writing, with as much
detail as possible, when the COR has taken an action or has issued
direction (written or oral) that the contractor considers to exceed the
COR's appointment, within 3 days of the occurrence.

Unless otherwise provided in this agreement, the contractor assumes all
costs, risks and consequences of performing any work it is directed to
perform that falls within any of the categories defined in paragraph
7.2.3. prior to receipt of the CO's response issued under paragraph
7.2.4 of this clause.

**7.2.4** The CO shall respond in writing within 30 days to any notice
made under paragraph 7.2.3 of this clause.

**7.2.5** The contractor shall provide copies of all correspondence to
the CO and the COR.

**7.2.6** Any action(s) taken by the contractor, in response to any
direction given by any person acting on behalf of the government or any
government official other than the CO or the COR acting within his or
her appointment, shall be at the contractor's risk.

### 7.3 Contractor Administration 

The contractor must provide the name of the individual responsible for
centralized contract administration in support of all work performed
under this order. This individual, at a minimum, will serve as the point
of contact for contractual issues, invoices, and the contractor
representative for annual performance reviews (see section 7.5).

The information, inclusive of the name of the point of contact, email,
and phone number, shall be uploaded through the Assisted Services Share
Information System (ASSIST) Collaboration tool.

### 7.4 Post Award Orientation Conference

The government\'s team (CO, COR, and Product Owner) will hold a kickoff
meeting (or post-award conference) with the selected contractor within
ten calendar days of the acquisition award. This kickoff will include
the selected contractor's team and other relevant government staff to
review and clarify the project's objectives, expectations from the
government, and address any questions the selected contractor may have.

### 7.5 Contractor Performance

In accordance with FAR 8.406-7 and FAR 42.1502(c), past performance
evaluations shall be prepared at least annually, at the time the work
under the order is completed (to include options), and when an order,
individually, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. These
evaluations are generally for the entity, division, or unit that
performed the contract or order.

1.  Evaluating contractor Performance: The General Services
    > Administration uses the Contractor Performance Assessment
    > Reporting System (CPARS) module as the secure, confidential,
    > information management tool to facilitate the performance
    > evaluation process. CPARS enables a comprehensive evaluation by
    > capturing comments from both TTS and the contractor. The website
    > for CPARS is
    > [[http://www.cpars.gov]{.underline}](http://www.cpars.gov).
    > Completed CPARS evaluations are sent to the Past Performance
    > Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) which may then be used by the
    > federal acquisition community in making source selection
    > decisions. PPIRS assists acquisition officials by serving as the
    > single source for contractor past performance data.

2.  CPARS Registration: Each award requiring an evaluation must be
    > registered in CPARS. The awardee will receive several automated
    > emails. Within thirty days of award, the contractor will receive
    > an email that contains user account information, as well as the
    > applicable contract and order number(s) assigned. The contractor
    > will be granted one user account to access all evaluations.

3.  Contractor CPARS Training: The contractor may sign up for CPARS
    > training. A schedule of classes will be posted to the [[CPARS
    > training
    > site]{.underline}](http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm) and
    > updated as needed.

4.  Contractor Representative (CR) Role: All evaluations will be sent to
    > the CR named on your award. The CR will be able to access CPARS to
    > review and comment on the evaluation. If your CR is not already in
    > the CPARS system, the contracting officer will request the name
    > and email address of the person that will be responsible for the
    > CR role on your award.

Once an evaluation is ready to be released by the government, the CR
will receive an email that the evaluation is ready for their review and
comment. The email will indicate the time frame the CR has to respond to
the evaluation. The CR may return the evaluation earlier than this date.

TTS shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer
(i.e., contracting director) to consider any disagreement between TTS
and the contractor regarding TTS's evaluation of the contractor. Based
on the review, the individual at a level above the contracting officer
will issue the ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation.\
Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the contract file.

8.0 Invoicing

Include resumes for the Facilitator, Technical Lead, and Design Lead.
The resumes must include a brief description of the experience and
capability for each individual, **but cannot exceed one page in length
each**.

Contractors proposing Key Personnel who are not currently employed by
the contractor or a teaming partner must include a signed letter of
intent from the proposed individual who intends to participate in this
project for at least one year. The letter of intent **cannot exceed one
page in length each.**

#### 9.2.4 Factor 3 - Similar Experience

The contractor must demonstrate similar experience by sharing one or
more source code samples that provide the government evaluation team
with the full revision history for all files. The contractor may submit
links to Git repositories or equivalent version-controlled repositories.

The repositories may be public or private. If a contractor submits a
link to a private source code repository, the government will provide
the contractor with one or more user identities by email, and the
contractor will be expected to provide the identified user(s) with
access to the private source code repository within two business days.

Other artifacts that would be relevant to evaluating the code sample may
be linked to from within the repository.

The source code samples should be for projects that are similar in size,
scope, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ. The source
code must have been developed by either the contractor, a teaming
partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or an individual that
is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project.

Source code samples from recent projects involving teams of
approximately four to seven full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel are
preferable.

The government expects repositories to contain documentation with
background information about the source code repository. Please provide
only links to source code repositories in the similar experience section
(Factor 3) of the Appendix 2.

If a contractor wishes to submit a sample repository that was done as
part of a contract award with another government agency, but lacks the
necessary privileges to share with OFA and 18F, then you may provide the
name of the agency, a point of contact, and a brief description of
performance (less than 200 words). The government will make one request
to get access as a peer government agency, but if the government is not
able to obtain access to the code within the expected milestone
schedule, then the contractor will be deemed nonresponsive.

Contractors are strongly encouraged to submit sample repositories that
they are capable of sharing source code rather than share one at risk of
being deemed nonresponsive.

If the code samples provided do not include user research plans
demonstrating how ongoing user research was incorporated into the
project, then the contractor must submit a separate user research plan
relating to at least one of the sample projects. This user research plan
should include:

1.  A [[research plan that covers the items in this
    > template]{.underline}](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/resources/research-plan.md)

2.  An interview protocol that shows your introduction, a sample of
    > questions asked, and closing. Do not include responses.

3.  A short summary of the findings of this research, how those findings
    > affected your work, and how your research continued after this
    > iteration

If a research plan was submitted with RFI \#2, the same research plan
can be submitted, but must be uploaded with the proposal. The user
research plan can either be equivalent to 10 pages (8.5x11") if printed,
or a link to a publically available online resource (like a git wiki).

### 9.3 Phase 2 - Oral Interviews

#### 9.3.1 General Information 

After the initial Phase 1 confidence assignment, contractors who receive
an individual ranking of "Low Confidence" for any of the evaluation
factors in Phase 1 will **not** be invited to participate in Phase 2 -
Oral Interview or considered for award.

**Once interviews are complete, each contractor will be assigned a
confidence rating for their Oral Interview.**

#### 9.3.2 Interview Format

Each contractor will be scheduled for a 60-minute interview with the
evaluation team so the government can ask questions based on the
contractor\'s technical submission. Contractors should also introduce
the individuals on their proposed team. Lastly, the evaluation team will
ask questions about the contractor\'s expertise relative to the project.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last no longer than five
minutes. The contractor and government interview team members will
introduce themselves during this time.

Each interview will include an Open Technical Session during which
contractors will be asked about their technical submission (Phase 1).
The government expects these interviews to assist with assessing the
technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better
understand the proposed technical approach described in the contractor's
submission. All of the contractor's proposed Key Personnel must
participate in the interview.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last no more than 45
minutes. During this phase the contractor interview team will respond to
the government's questions related to the technical aspects of the
contractor's quote. Contractors will NOT be able to use or present any
slides, graphs, charts, or other written presentation materials,
including handouts. There will be no follow-up session for further
questions from the contractor after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will last no more than five
minutes, during which the contractor may make a short presentation
summarizing the contractor's responses to the government's questions.

The interview associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute
discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made
during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government
will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit
or allow revised quotes.

#### 9.3.3 Location

The interview sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may
be substituted as needed. The government will coordinate and set up the
virtual meeting.

**9.3.4 Date and Time**

After Phase 1, the government will schedule the date and time of
interviews with each contractor who moved to Phase 2. The government
reserves the right to reschedule any contractor's interview at the
discretion of the CO.

### 9.4 Phase 3 - Price Submissions

The government expects that the labor categories, staffing levels and
total estimated hours set forth by the contractor in the pricing sheet
will be consistent with the contractor's staffing plan and with their
GSA Schedule contract pricing.

The contractor will be compensated at fully loaded hourly rates. The
evaluation team intends to evaluate quotes without discussions with
contractors, and therefore the contractor's initial quote should contain
the contractor's best terms.

Contractors are required to offer discounts below GSA Schedule contract
rates. When discounts are offered, quotations must clearly identify the
contract rate, the discount rate, and the percentage discount for each
item or labor rate being discounted.

The contractor must provide a copy of their GSA price lists for all
three years for verification of pricing. If submitting a quote as a
contractor teaming arrangement (CTA), each member must submit their GSA
Schedule pricing for each special item number (SIN) they are eligible to
perform under. If price discounts are not provided on the GSA price
list, then the contractor will be deemed unacceptable.

For contractors that do not have out-year pricing, your task order
pricing may be escalated at the same percentage of your GSA multiple
award schedule (MAS) contract provided you submit a copy of a valid
executed modification of your GSA MAS Schedule to the CO.

The government is expecting price reductions for every rate proposed for
the entire period(s) of performance. Prices will be verified to ensure
they do not exceed the contractor\'s GSA Schedule contract price. Quotes
proposing labor rates that exceed those established in the contractor's
GSA contract will not be considered for award.

### 

Contractors will submit the attached spreadsheet (Appendix 3) detailing
the labor categories, contract rates, discount rates and discount
percentages. This submission must not be submitted in PDF format.

The spreadsheet attached to this solicitation must be completed and
returned in Excel format with formulae intact. Submission of any other
price sheet will constitute a nonresponsive quote.

### 9.5 Basis of Award and Evaluation Factors

The government will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria
set forth below and then make an award based on best value using
tradeoffs. The government intends to use a phased approach for this
procurement as described below. To be considered for award, contractors
must successfully pass each phase.\
\
The government will award a task order resulting from this RFQ to the
responsible contractor whose quote conforms to the RFQ and represents
the best value to the government, considering price and the other
factors specified below. Contractors are advised that the non-price
evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than
price. As non-price ratings become closer, price will become more
important.

-   Phase 1 -- Technical Submission

    -   **Factor 1**: Technical Approach

    -   **Factor 2**: Staffing Plan

    -   **Factor 3**: Similar Experience

-   Phase 2 - Oral Interview

-   Phase 3 - Price Submission

Quotes that do not contain information required in the RFQ
(nonresponsive) or quotes that have received a "Low Confidence" rating
for any factor will no longer be considered for award. Therefore,
contractors who receive a rating of "Low Confidence" in any factor in
Phase 1 will **not** be invited to participate in Phase 2 - Oral
Interview, contractors who receive a rating of "Low Confidence" in Phase
2 will not advance to price evaluation.

The government will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by
evaluating the hourly rate for each labor category and the overall
discount provided off the contractor's GSA Schedule pricing. This will
include evaluating estimated hours submitted by the contractor for the
purpose of considering the estimated total cost to the government. The
government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option
prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options under FAR
52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last
option period to determine the price for a six-month option period,
which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the
total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to
exercise the option(s).

The government also reserves the right to make no award.

**NOTE: The government anticipates selecting an awardee based on initial
quotes received; therefore, contractors are cautioned to submit their
best price and technical quotes in the initial submission.**

### 9.6 Evaluation

#### 9.6.1 Factor 1 - Technical Approach

In evaluating a contractor's technical approach, the government will
consider:

-   Does the proposed approach include programming language(s) and
    > frameworks and does it describe how these could integrate within
    > the Operating Constraints (section 5.0) and the current
    > prototyping infrastructure (section 1.4)?

-   Does the contractor describe how they will develop the software in
    > an open and agile manner? Have they included plans for employing
    > user research, human centered design, and open source code?

-   Does the contractor demonstrate a clear understanding of the project
    > details and goals?

-   Does the contractor identify potential obstacles to efficient
    > development and plans to overcome those potential obstacles?

-   If the contractor plans to provide services through a joint venture,
    > teaming partner, or subcontractor, have they detailed those plans?

#### 9.6.2 Factor 2 - Staffing Plan

In evaluating a contractor's staffing plan, the government will
consider:

-   Does the contractor's staffing plan meet the requirements of this
    > project?

-   Were the titles of each of the labor categories proposed included in
    > the staffing plan?

-   Was the level of effort specified for each member of the proposed
    > team?

-   Were the names of the individuals who will fill the roles of
    > Facilitator, Technical Lead, and Design Lead specified in the
    > staffing plan?

-   Were members of the proposed team involved in the development of the
    > source code sample? To what extent?

-   Did the proposed team, as a whole, have experience in at least ten
    > of the following areas?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Agile development practices

-   Automated testing (unit/integration/end-to-end)

-   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

-   Refactoring to minimize technical debt

-   Application Protocol Interface (API) development and documentation

-   Open-source software development

-   Cloud deployment

-   Open-source login/authentication services

-   Product management and strategy

-   Usability research (ie. stakeholder interviews usability testing)

-   User experience and product design

-   Wireframing, prototyping, and usertask flow development

-   Content design and copywriting

-   Building and testing public-facing sites and tools

-   User outreach and user adoption strategy

-   Database design and SQL queries

-   Security and compliance

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Did the contractor include a one page resume for the Facilitator,
    > Technical Lead, and Design Lead?

-   Was a signed letter of intent included for each individual proposed
    > as Key Personnel that doesn't currently work for the contractor
    > and intends to participate in this project for at least one year?

#### 9.6.3 Factor 3 - Similar Experience

In evaluating a contractor's similar experience, the government will
consider:

-   Did the contractor provide links to version-controlled repositories
    > for one or more source code samples that provide the full revision
    > history for all files?

-   If the contractor submitted a source code sample in a private source
    > code repository, did the contractor provide the government with
    > access to the repository within two business days?

-   Were appropriate artifacts linked to from the repository?

-   Were the submitted source code samples of a similar size, scope, and
    > complexity to the project described in this RFQ?

-   Was the source code sample developed by the contractor, a teaming
    > partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or an individual
    > that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Were source code samples from recent projects involving teams of
    > approximately four to seven full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel?

-   Did the contractor submit a user research plan relating to at least
    > one of the sample projects that included a research plan,
    > interview protocol, and summary of findings, and was the user
    > research plan comprehensive?

-   Does the source code sample/s generally adhere to the best practice
    > outlined in the QASP that is included in this solicitation
    > (Section 3.2)? Do the samples demonstrate mastery of testing code,
    > properly styling code, accessibility, deployment, documentation,
    > security, and incorporating user research?

####  9.6.4 Phase 2 - Oral Interview

In evaluating a contractor's Oral interview, the government will
consider:

-   Did the proposed Key Personnel attend and to what extent did they
    > participate in the interview?

-   Did the contractor Orally contradict any part of their written
    > response to the RFQ?

-   Did the contractor demonstrate an understanding of the government's
    > objectives?

Any statements made during the Oral interview that contradict the
written technical submission could result in a lower confidence rating.

As stated above, the Oral interview does not and will not constitute
discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made
during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government
will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit
or allow revised quotes.

#### 9.6.5 Phase 3 - Price

In evaluating a contractor's price, the government will consider the
contractor's total estimated costs for the development services for
three years (a base year period plus two one-year option periods).
Contractors will use this [[spreadsheet to submit pricing
information]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gHAF8oBsC5oMWsQN2VtKSjtM8rhX2uFDnEYRw9kYu9M/edit#gid=0).

The government will not evaluate travel costs. A lump sum will be
included as a separate contract line item number (CLIN) and will be used
to reimburse actual travel expenses as needed.
