# Draft TANF Data Reporting System (TDRS) RFQ

## Introduction

The Office of Family Assistance (OFA) within the Administration for
Children and Families (ACF) administers the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (TANF) program on behalf of the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS). Since 1996, the TANF program has served as one of
the nation's primary economic security and stability programs for
low-income families with children. TANF is a block grant that provides
$16.6 billion annually to states, territories, the District of
Columbia, and federally-recognized Indian tribes. These TANF
jurisdictions use federal TANF funds to provide income support as well
as a wide range of services to vulnerable families with minor children.

As part of oversight and administration of the TANF Program, OFA
operates the TANF Data Reporting System (TDRS).

OFA's state, territory, and tribal TANF grantees submit data to TDRS
that they are legislatively-mandated to report. OFA then aggregates the
data and uses it for descriptive analyses and program accountability,
most notably through the work participation rate calculations.

The existing system was developed in the late 1990s using late 80s
technology, and thus is difficult to operate and use.  OFA intends
to replace this system with a modern system using open source
technologies that will ease these problems and give them much more
control over their data.

Here we provide [a draft of the Request for Quotes (RFQ)](RFQ.md) that
we intend to release to solicit software development services to build our
new Tanf Data Reporting System.

We intend to release the final RFQ **TBD**
with responses due **TBD**.
