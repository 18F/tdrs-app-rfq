# Data Reporting RFQ

Developing an RFQ to procure a new data reporting system for the the Office of Family Assistance (OFA) within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

## Introduction

OFA administers the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program on behalf of HHS.

Since 1996, the TANF program has served as one of the nationâ€™s primary economic security and stability programs for low-income families with children. TANF is a grant that provides $16.6 billion annually to states, territories, the District of Columbia, and federally-recognized Indian tribes. These TANF jurisdictions use federal TANF funds to provide income support as well as a wide range of services to vulnerable families with minor children.

As part of oversight and administration of the TANF Program, OFA operates the TANF Data Reporting System (TDRS). OFA's state, territory, and tribal TANF grantees submit data to TDRS that they are legislatively-mandated to report. OFA then aggregates the data and uses it for descriptive analyses and program accountability.

OFA intends to develop and deploy a new data reporting system that uses open source software.
Here we provide a [draft of the Request for Quotes (RFQ)](RFQ.md) that we intend to release to solicit software development services to build our new data reporting system.

We intend to release the final RFQ later this month with responses due within 3-4 weeks of its release.

## Background

### What we're hoping to achieve as a result of this acquisition

We want a wholesale replacement of our data reporting system. Our goal is not to create a feature-level duplication of our legacy system, but instead to have a thoughtful software development process by which the various users of the system have their needs addressed. 

### How to respond

The purpose of posting this draft of the RFQ is to solicit feedback from any interested parties, including vendors of software development services. Feedback should be submitted in the following ways:
  1. Submit a response to this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NYK7Ok5tswQ3wMxERGaMSwH36HojNzUApQWj2lKMUPo/edit) and 
  1. Changes proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq/pulls) or by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq/issues/). 

Responses are due by 12pm ET on February 19, 2020.

Note that we are *not* seeking proposals at this time.

### Contract Term

The order will be for an initial period of one year, and OFA will have options to extend the initial period for a total of up to two additional years.

### Budget

OFA will pay up to $1.4 million for services during the first year, and up to $1.4 million during each of the two option years.
