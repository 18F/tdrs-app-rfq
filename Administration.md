centralized contract administration in support of all work performed
under this order. This individual, at a minimum, will serve as the point
of contact for contractual issues, invoices, and the contractor
representative for annual performance reviews (see [Contractor Performance](#Contractor-Performance)).

The information, inclusive of the name of the point of contact, email,
and phone number, shall be uploaded through the ITSS Collaboration tool.

## Post Award Orientation Conference

The government's team (CO, COR, and Product Owner) will hold a kickoff
meeting (or post-award conference) with the selected contractor within
10 calendar days of the acquisition award. This kickoff will include the
selected contractor's team and other relevant government staff to review
and clarify the project's objectives, expectations from the government,
and address any questions the selected contractor may have.

## Contractor Performance

In accordance with FAR 8.406-7 and FAR 42.1502(c), past performance
evaluations shall be prepared at least annually and at the time the work
under the order is completed (to include options) when an order,
individually, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. These
evaluations are generally for the entity, division, or unit that
performed the contract or order.

1. Evaluating Contractor Performance: The General Services
Administration is using the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting
System (CPARS) module as the secure, confidential, information
management tool to facilitate the performance evaluation process. CPARS
enables a comprehensive evaluation by capturing comments from both TTS
and the contractor. The website for CPARS is
[http://www.cpars.gov](http://www.cpars.gov) Completed
CPARS evaluations are sent to the Past Performance Information Retrieval
System (PPIRS) which may then be used by Federal acquisition community
for use in making source selection decisions. PPIRS assists acquisition
officials by serving as the single source for contractor past
performance data.
1. CPARS Registration: Each award requiring an evaluation must be
registered in CPARS. The awardee will receive several automated emails.
Within thirty days of award, the contractor will receive an email that
contains user account information, as well as the applicable contract
and order number(s) assigned. The contractor will be granted one user
account to access all evaluations.
1. Contractor CPARS Training: The contractor may sign up for CPARS
training. A schedule of classes will be posted to the [CPARS training
site](http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm) and updated as needed.
1. Contractor Representative (CR) Role: All evaluations will be sent
to the contractor Representative (CR) named on your award. The CR will
be able to access CPARS to review and comment on the evaluation. If your
CR is not already in the CPARS system, the contracting officer will
request the name and email address of the person that will be
responsible for the CR role on your award.

Once an evaluation is ready to be released the CR will receive an email
alerting them the evaluation is ready for their review and comment. The
email will indicate the time frame the CR has to respond to the
evaluation; however, the CR may return the evaluation earlier than this
date.

TTS shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer
(i.e., contracting director) to consider any disagreement between TTS
and the contractor regarding TTS's evaluation of the contractor. Based
on the review, the individual at a level above the contracting officer
will issue the ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation.
Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the contract file.

# Invoicing

## Invoicing Schedule

The Contractor may invoice once services or products, for the awarded
type and quantity of the order, have been delivered, inspected (which
includes, but is not limited to confirming that the services were
rendered and/or product(s) were delivered and function properly, and are
accessible and usable by the teams using the product) and accepted by
written confirmation of the COR through the CO. Acceptance will occur
electronically via GSA's electronic Web-Based Order Processing System,
currently ITSS, by accepting the Acceptance Document generated by the
Contractor. Electronic acceptance of the invoice by the COR is
considered concurrence and acceptance of services.

The Contractor must submit a final invoice within 60 calendar days from
government acceptance. No further charges are to be billed following the
final invoice submission. A completed and signed Release of Claims
([GSA Form 1142](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/release-claims))
shall be uploaded to the ITSS with the submission of a final invoice.

## Content of Invoice

In addition to the items below, the Contractor shall submit proper
invoices as specified in FAR 52.212-4(g):

-   GSA Order Number
-   Order ACT Number
-   QP Number (funding document number)
-   Prompt Payment Discount
-   Remittance Address
-   POP for Billing Period
-   POC and Phone Number
-   Invoice Amount
-   Final Invoice Marked as 'Final'
-   Name of Product, Quantity of Product, and Part Number of Product
    Matching award documents.

All of this information, along with the Period of Performance covered by
the invoice, must be included on each invoice in addition to the
requirements for a proper invoice specified in FAR 52.212-4 (g), the
Prompt Payment clause, FAR 52.212-4(i)(2) and Payments under Time and
Materials and Labor Hours Contracts, FAR 52.232-7.

## Invoice Submission

Contractors shall electronically transmit/submit invoices and supporting
documentation for invoices through the GSA web-based procurement system,
through the Central Invoice Service (CIS), the contractor shall submit
invoices electronically by logging into the ASSIST portal
([https://portal.fas.gsa.gov](https://portal.fas.gsa.gov)),
navigating to the appropriate order, and creating the invoice for
that order. This is the only acceptable means for invoice submissions.

No paper invoices shall be accepted. For additional assistance, contact
the ASSIST Helpdesk at 877-472-4877.

## Limitation of Funds

The Contractor shall not provide volumes of product resulting in charges
to the government that exceed obligated funds. The contractor shall
notify the Contracting Officer, and the COR, in writing, whenever it has
reason to believe that in the next 90 days, the charges to the
government will exceed 75% of the obligated funds. The notice shall
state the estimated amount of additional funds required to complete
performance of this task. The government is not obligated to reimburse
the Contractor for charges in excess of the obligated funds and the
Contractor is not obligated to continue performance or otherwise incur
costs that would result in charges to the government in excess of the
amount obligated under this order. Alerting the government in this
timeframe will allow the government to have additional funding approved
internally so another order can be placed (as needed).

# TTS Transparency Policy & Security Requirements

Contractors are advised that TTS reserves the right to publish documents
associated with this requirement on a publicly-available website,
including any Requests for Quotation (including amendments), Question
and Answer exchanges with contractors (source-identifying information
removed), and other relevant information that is not confidential or
proprietary in nature or source selection sensitive information that
would otherwise implicate procurement integrity concerns.

Upon award, TTS may publish the total awarded price and certain
non-source-identifying data (for example, the number of bids, the mean
price, median, and standard deviation of price). During the performance
of this task order, TTS may similarly publish data related to project
management (for example, user stories, milestones, and performance
metrics) and top-line spending data.

## Section 508 Compliance

The contractor shall support the Government in its compliance with
Section 508 throughout the development and implementation of the work to
be performed.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C.
794d) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or
use electronic information technology, Federal employees with
disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is
comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who do not have
disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.
Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are
members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal
agency, have access to and use of information and data that is
comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with
disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

The contractor should review the following websites for additional 508
information:

- https://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards
- http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources

Performance of this Task Order may require that personnel have access to
Privacy Information. Contractor personnel shall adhere to the Privacy
Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a and any other applicable
applicable rules and regulations.

## Protection of Information

The Contractor shall be responsible for properly protecting all
information used, gathered, disclosed, or developed as a result of work
under this Task Order. The Contractor shall also protect all Government
data by treating information as sensitive. All information gathered or
created under this Task Order shall be considered as Sensitive but
Unclassified (SBU) information. The use of this data is subject to the

## Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables

*Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables* -- OFA intends that all
software and documentation delivered by the Contractor will be made
publicly available without restriction. This software and documentation
includes, but is not limited to, data, documents, graphics, code, plans,
reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the
like; all new open source software created by the Contractor and forks
or branches of current open source software where the Contractor has
made a modification; and all new tooling, scripting configuration
management, infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits
to successfully deploy or operate the software. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing is included in the definition of \"data\" set forth
in the FAR clause at 52.227-17, incorporated into this contract.

To the extent that the Contractor seeks to incorporate into the software
delivered under this task order any software that was not first produced
in the performance of this task order, OFA encourages the Contractor to
incorporate either software that is in the public domain, or free and
open source software that qualifies under the Open Source Definition
promulgated by the Open Source Initiative. In any event, the Contractor
must promptly disclose to OFA in writing, and list in the documentation,
any software incorporated in the delivered software that is subject to a
license fee.

If software delivered by the Contractor incorporates software that is
subject to an open source license that provides implementation guidance,
then the Contractor must ensure compliance with that guidance. If
software delivered by the Contractor incorporates software that is
subject to an open source license that does not provide implementation
guidance, then the Contractor must attach or include the terms of the
license within the work itself, such as in code comments at the
beginning of a file, or in a license file within a software repository.

In addition, the Contractor must obtain written permission from OFA
before incorporating into the delivered software any software that is
subject to a license that does not qualify under the Open Source
Definition promulgated by the Open Source Initiative. If the \[agency\]
grants such written permission, then the Contractor's rights to use that
software must be promptly assigned to OFA.

The Government data rights of software deliverables and all other data
first produced in the performance of this task order shall be in
accordance with **FAR 52.227-17 Rights in Data \-- Special Works**. The
Government intends for all such data to be dedicated to the public
domain and, to that end, may require the contractor to assign its
copyright in such data to the Government in accordance with **FAR
52.227-17(c)(1)(ii)** or to publicly post it with an appropriate notice.

Ownership of code repositories furnished as Government-Furnished
Information (GFI) and Government-provided data entered into any and all
systems, system documentation, and other related system information
shall reside with the Government.

## Personnel Security Requirements

Contractor shall furnish documentation reflecting favorable adjudication
of background investigations for all personnel (including
subcontractors) supporting the system. Contractors shall comply with

-   GSA Order CIO 2100.1,
-   "GSA Information Technology (IT) Security Policy," and GSA Order CIO
    P 2181.1,

GSA separates the risk levels for personnel working on Federal computer
systems into three categories: Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Risk.

-   Those contract personnel (hereafter known as "Applicant") determined
    to be in a Low Risk position will require a National Agency Check
    with Written Inquiries (NACI) investigation.
-   Those Applicants determined to be in a Moderate Risk position will
    require either a Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or a
    Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) based on the Contracting
    Officer's (CO) determination.
-   Those Applicants determined to be in a High Risk position will
    require a Background Investigation (BI).

Applicants will not be reinvestigated if a prior favorable adjudication
is on file with FPS or GSA, there has been less than a one year break in
service, and the position is identified at the same or lower risk level.

Once a favorable FBI Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) has been
returned, Applicants may receive a GSA identity credential (if required)
and initial access to GSA information systems. The HSPD-12 Handbook
contains procedures for obtaining identity credentials and access to GSA
information systems as well as procedures to be followed in case of
unfavorable adjudications.

GSA shall sponsor the investigation when deemed necessary. No access
shall be given to government computer information systems and government
sensitive information without a background investigation being verified
or in process. If results of background investigation are not
acceptable, then access shall be terminated.

The Contractor shall provide a report of separated staff on a monthly
basis, beginning 60 days after execution of the option period.
