## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a HHS open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask â€” or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here) and its [README](README.md).
